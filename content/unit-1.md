# Newton’s Laws
## Newton's First Law
An object’s acceleration is 0 (its velocity is constant) if it is not being acted upon by a net force.
 - Net force is the sum of all forces acting on an object. It is usually represented mathematically as \\(\sum F\\).
 - When an object is in equilibrium (there is no acceleration), the following equation is true:
\\[ \sum F = 0 \\]

## Newton's Second Law
Newton’s second law is the formula:
\\[ \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \\]
Where \\(\sum \vec{F}\\) is the net force acting on an object, m is the object’s mass, and a is the object’s acceleration.

## Newton's Third Law
Every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force.
 - When the earth’s gravity pulls on you, your gravity pulls on the earth with the same strength and in the opposite direction.
 - All forces exist in pairs like this.

# Types of Forces
## Gravity
The strength of the force of gravity on the earth’s surface follows the formula:
\\[F_g = mg\\]
Where \\(F_g\\) is the force of gravity on an object, \\(m\\) is the object’s mass, and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (\\(-10m/s^2\\) in AP Physics).

## Normal Force
This is the force between two surfaces that are pressed together. When an object is on a horizontal surface, the force normal cancels out the force of gravity, preventing the object from falling through the floor. Normal force is denoted by \\(F_N\\).

## Friction
There are two types of friction: Static and kinetic

### Static Friction
Static friction exists when an object is at rest. If you try to push an object sideways and it doesn’t move, the force of static friction is cancelling out the force of your hand. The maximum value of static friction follows the formula:
\\[F_f = \mu_s F_N\\]
Where \\(F_f\\) is the force of static friction, \\(F_N\\) is the force normal, and \\(\mu_s\\) is a dimensionless constant called the static friction coefficient.
 - The coefficient of static friction will try to vary such that \\(F_f\\) cancels out all other forces, but it can never become greater than \\(\mu_s F_N\\).
 - If you overcome static friction and cause an object to move, kinetic friction takes over.

### Kinetic Friction
Kinetic friction follows the formula:
\\[F_f = \mu_k F_N\\]
Where \\(\mu_k\\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
 - \\(\mu_k\\) is a constant value which depends on the materials being used and other environmental factors. The kinetic frictional force will oppose the object’s motion, but it will not completely stop it.

<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <p><strong>Practice Problem</strong> A block of mass \(m\), which has an initial velocity \(v_0\) at time \(t=0\), slides on a horizontal surface. If the sliding friction force \(F\) exerted on the block by the surface is directly proportional to its velocity (that is, \(f = -kv\)) determine the following:</p>
  <ol type="a">
     <li>The acceleration \(a\) of the block in terms of \(m\), \(k\), and \(v\).</li>
     <li>The speed \(v\) of the block as a function of time \(t\). </li>
     <li>The total distance the block slides.</li>
 </ol>
</div>

# Circular Motion
 - An object is undergoing uniform circular motion when it moves in a circular path at constant speed.
 - In uniform circular motion, the object’s acceleration follows the formula:
\\[a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} \\]
 - The object’s velocity vector is tangent to the circular path it follows, and the acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector.
